# airplane_design_toolbox
A set of tools to help establishing an initial design for a new airframe.

## Tools
- airfoils-comparison: Uses XFoil to compute polars of numerous NACA airfoils, simplifying airfoil selection for specific needs
- sizing-tool: Excel sheet to compute approximative wing dimensions and flight range/autonomy
